This is my submission for the first peer assessment of the Reproducible Research course.



#1. Number of steps taken per day

The mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day are 1.076619 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> and 1.0765 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>, respectively.


#2. Average daily activity pattern

The interval with the maximum number of steps is 835.


#3. Missing values


The number of missing values in the data is 2304.

The mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day with data imputation are 1.076619 &times; 10<sup>4</sup> and 1.076619 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>, respectively.

Thus, using interval means as imputation values yields post-imputation mean and median values that are very close to their pre-imputation counterparts.


#4. Differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends
