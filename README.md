This is Vishal-Bhatia's submission for the first assigment for the Reproducible Research course.

This repo contains the primary data ("activity.csv"), and the analyses file ("PA1_template.Rmd"). For the analyses to run fine, the following are needed:
1. both files are to be saved in the R session working directory;
2. the "lattice" package has to be downloaded and installed.
3. knitr.r has been added to be able to translate the code into a more visual form
4. the code in knitr.r has been executed
5. the result has been pushed back into this forked version
