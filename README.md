This is my submission for the first assigment for the Reproducible Research course.

This repo contains the primary data ("activity.csv"), and the analyses file (PA1_template.Rmd). For the analyses to run fine, the following are needed:
1. both files are to be saved in the session working directory;
2. the "lattice" has to be downloaded and installed.
